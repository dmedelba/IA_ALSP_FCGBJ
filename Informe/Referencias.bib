The determination of capacity is examined with discussion of the influence which air traffic control factors, demand characteristics, environmental conditions and engineering design will have on capacity. The methods used to assess delay are detailed along with extensive data sketching the current state of Europe's system of large airports and the extent of infrastructure congestion. The options available to policy makers to improve the management and organisation of capacity are set out and critically discussed."

 abstract = {In this paper we define a generic decision problem - the displacement problem. The displacement problem arises when we have to make a sequence of decisions and each new decision that must be made has an explicit link back to the previous decision that was made. This link is quantified by means of the displacement function. One situation where the displacement problem arises is that of dynamically scheduling aircraft landings at an airport. Here decisions about the landing times for aircraft (and the runways they land on) must be taken in a dynamic fashion as time passes and the operational environment changes. We illustrate the application of the displacement problem to the dynamic aircraft landing problem. Computational results are presented for a number of publicly available test problems involving up to 500 aircraft and five runways.},

abstract = "The Aircraft Landing Scheduling (ALS) problem has been a complex and challenging problem in air traffic control for a long time. In practice, it can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem that needs to be solved in real-time. Although quite a few optimization techniques, e.g., linear programming-based approaches and evolutionary algorithms, have been shown to be good solver of ALS problems with small number of aircrafts, their relatively high computational cost prohibits their applications in the real world. In this paper, we propose a cellular automata optimization (CAO) approach to the ALS problem. The CAO approach solves the ALS problem in two major steps. First, a good aircraft landing sequence is obtained by simulating the aircraft landing process using a CA model. Then, the exact landing time of each aircraft is determined by a simple yet effective local search procedure. Experimental study on 13 data sets in the OR-Library was conducted to compare the CAO approach and several popular approaches in the literature. It was observed that the CAO method managed to attain high quality solutions on most of the test problem. More importantly, the computational time (in CPU seconds) of CAO method is extremely short. In most cases, satisfactory solutions can be obtained by the CAO approach within 4s, which perfectly fulfills the requirement of the real-world air traffic control system."

    abstract = { An expression is developed for the landing capacity (or service rate) of a single runway in which aircraft are restricted by a minimum space separation at the beginning of a common approach glide path and by a minimum time separation at the runway. The conditions at any terminal may be inserted to determine its characteristic landing capacity. Single runways at the New York area terminals are shown to have landing capacities of 30–40 landings per hour. It is shown that the greatest improvement in the present landing rate can be achieved by reducing the separation at the beginning of the common path, and that little is gained by reducing only the time separation at the runway. }

abstract = "The aircraft landing problem (ALP) is the problem of allocating an airport’s runways to arriving aircraft as well as scheduling the landing time of aircraft, with the objective of minimizing the total deviation from the target landing times. We propose a simple heuristic to solve ALP. The distinguishing factor of the proposed algorithm includes decomposing the problem into a chain of smaller and easier-to-solve problems. We show that utilizing this strategy is very effective in solving the problem in a short time. Our work is motivated by the dynamic nature of the problem, i.e., due to the continuous changes in the number of arriving flights and a short window for determining the landing schedule, the air traffic controller needs to solve the problem on a regular basis and update the landing schedule, and fast and effective algorithms are therefore paramount. By solving two sets of 124 benchmark instances we demonstrate that we fulfill this aim and that the proposed algorithm obtains satisfactory solutions in a short amount of time."

abstract = "The capacity of a runway system represents a bottleneck at many international airports. The current practice at airports is to land approaching aircraft on a first-come, first-served basis. An active rescheduling of aircraft landing times increases runway capacity or reduces delays. The problem of finding an optimal schedule for aircraft landings is referred to as the “aircraft landing problem”. The objective is to minimize the total delay of aircraft landings or the respective cost. The necessary separation time between two operations must be met. Due to the complexity of this scheduling problem, recent research has been focused on developing heuristic solution approaches. This article presents a new algorithm that is able to create optimal landing schedules on multiple independent runways for aircraft with positive target landing times and limited time windows. Our numerical experiments show that problems with up to 100 aircraft can be optimally solved within seconds."
